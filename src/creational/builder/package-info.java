/**
 * Builder pattern
 *
 * Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step.
 * The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.
 * https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/builder
 *
 * <p>
 *  - avoiding multiply parameters in constructors;
 *  - we need to use Builder Design Pattern when there is multiply constructor in the class or might be expand in the future;
 * </p>
