/**
 * Facade pattern
 *
 * Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.
 * https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/facade
 *
 *  <p>
 *  - defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use;
 *  - hides the complexities of the system; *
 * </p>
