/**
 * Decorator pattern
 *
 * Decorator is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects
 * inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.
 * https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/decorator
 *
 * <p>
 *  - dynamically changes the functionality of an object at runtime without impacting the existing functionality of the objects;
 *  - adds additional functionalities to the object by wrapping it;
 *  - remember how to create car with diesel engine and car with petrol engine, or pizza decorator;
 * </p>
