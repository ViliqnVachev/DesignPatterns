/**
 * Strategy pattern
 *
 * The Strategy Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern.
 *  It allows you to dynamically change the behavioral of an object by encapsulating it into different strategies.
 *  https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-beginners-guide-to-the-strategy-design-pattern/
 *
 *  <p>
 *   - define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable;
 *   - Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it;
 *   - is used when we have multiple algorithms (solutions) for a specific task and the client decides the actual implementation to be used at runtime;
 *  </p>
