/**
 * State pattern
 *
 * The State Design pattern is a behavioral design pattern.
 * It lets an object alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
 * It appears as if the object changed its class.
 * https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/state
 *
 * <p>
 *  - allows an object to completely change its behavior depending upon its current internal state;
 *  - ATM machine behavior is the best example of the State Design Pattern;
