/**
 * Visitor pattern
 *
 *  Visitor is a behavioral design pattern that lets you separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate.
 *  https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/visitor
 *
 *  <p>
 *  - as per the Visitor Design Pattern, the element object (every kid in the school) has to accept the visitor object (doctor, salesman);
 *  - the visitor object handles the operation on the element object;
