/**
 * Iterator pattern
 *
 *  Iterator is a behavioral design pattern that lets you traverse elements of a collection
 *  without exposing its underlying representation (list, stack, tree, etc.).
 *  The main idea of the Iterator pattern is to extract the traversal behavior of a collection into a separate object called an iterator.
 *  https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/iterator
 *
 *  <p>
 *  - the iterator pattern is a design pattern in which an iterator is used to traverse a container ( ist, Array List, Array, etc.)
 *  and access the elements of the container;
 *  - allows sequential access of elements without exposing the inside logic;
 *  - we can access the elements of a collection object in a sequential manner without any need to know its internal representations;
 *  </p>
