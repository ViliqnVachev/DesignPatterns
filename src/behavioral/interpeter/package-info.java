/**
 * Interpreter pattern
 *
 *  In short, the pattern defines the grammar of a particular language in an object-oriented way which can be evaluated by the interpreter itself.
 *  Having that in mind, technically we could build our custom regular expression, a custom DSL interpreter or we could parse any of the human languages,
 *  build abstract syntax trees and then run the interpretation.

 *  <p>
 *  - provides a way to evaluate language grammar or expression;
 *  - is used in SQL parsing, symbol processing engine, etc.
